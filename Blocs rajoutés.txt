"\nSummons a vivid retelling of Celebrimbor's Death\n\n Celebrimbor, the great Elven smith, forged many artifacts of beauty and power. When Sauron arrived in Eregion - disguised as Annatar the Fair - he taught Celebrimbor to make magic Rings of Power, which resulted in Celebrimbor creating the Three Elven Rings. Then Sauron went away to Orodruin, where he crafted the One Ring, to rule over the others. Celebrimbor, realizing this betrayal, sent the Three away for safekeeping and waged war against Sauron, ultimately losing his life."
